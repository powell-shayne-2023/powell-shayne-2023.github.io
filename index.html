                          Cross Country Captain 2018. I led my cross country team through warm up runs, pre-workout stretches, and after-workout stretches. Before every meet I would give everyone a pep talk to get the psyched up for the upcoming race. I'd also come up with group activities every now and then. I was chosen for this position by the coach because he saw that I was dedicated to the sport.

                          Track Captain 2019. I led my track team through warm up runs and pre-workout stretches. I'd give individual team mates pep talks if they were nervous and I'd cheer everyone on. I'd strike determination in my team mates by running my very hardest to the very last step across the finish line. I was chosen as team captain because the coach knew how dedicated to the sport and team I was.

                          Pool Grill Employee 2018 and 2019. I worked the front of the house at a country club's pool. What this job entails is taking orders, running orders, washing tables, washing dishes, making smoothies or milkshakes, sweeping floors, mopping floors, and taking out trash. On multiple occasions I was told that I deserved to get a raise. I worked hardest when others were barely working whatsoever. I found my home in the outside world on the hottest of days and worked hard to keep everything clean and the trash cans fillable.
